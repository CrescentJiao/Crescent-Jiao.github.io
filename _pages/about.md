<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Research assistant at the Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University, where I participated in AR app design and collected and analyzed data. I am doing research about improving learners' learning experience by learning with AR apps using learning analytics methods.

I graduated from the Faculty of Education <a href="https://english.bnu.edu.cn/">Beijing Normal University (BNU) (Âåó‰∫¨Â∏àËåÉÂ§ßÂ≠¶)</a> with a Master‚Äôs degree in Educational Technology,  advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Su-Cai" target="_blank"> Su Cai</a>.  I was a research assistant in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/lab/VR-AR-Education-Lab-Su-Cai" target="_blank"> "AR/VR+Education" Lab. 

My research interest includes learning analytics, AR, formative assessment, and collaborative learning. I have published 10+ papers in journals and international conferences related to educational technology. I am honored to present my papers in top conferences, such as AERA, ICALT, ICBL, ICCE and so on.




# üéì Research Interests

My academic interest is the design and application of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality in education and Game-based Learning. In the process of implementation, I am passionate about using quantitative/qualitative methods such as learning analytics to understand students' interactions in the learning environment, and thus using the analytics results to improve students' learning experience, such as using data visualization, dashboards, etc. 
		
- The design and development of AR/VR in education
- Learning science and technology, learning analytics, Multimodal learning analysis 
- AI, Automated assessment, formative assessment, stealth assessment
- Game-based Learning, Game design, interaction design
- generative AI, AI chatbox
  
To this end, I have made the following efforts:
	
 - Design learning environments using immersive technology and educational theories. I am excited about creating and designing.
	
 - Learning analytics and assessment. I am interested in discovering and interpreting the data generated from learning processes or learning outcomes.
   
 Recently, I have found that AI has great power, especially in content creation and data analytics,  so I am trying to integrate AI into the designing of learning environments and the analysis of data. So recently, I have been trying to explore:
 
 - Integrating generative AI into AR content creation
 - AI-supported automated assessment and analysis

**Using Augmented Reality to enhance students' representational fluency and self-efficacy**

Designed and implemented an AR-based multi-representational learning environment (MRLE) with three representations of linear functions to enhance middle school students' representational fluency and self-efficacy. Surveys, tests, and interview was conducted to analyze students' differences in learning sequences and preferences among students in terms of their representational learning profile.
